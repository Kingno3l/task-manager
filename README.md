# Task Manager - Solution Code

This project contains a solution code for the Task Manager practice problem. In the exercise, I built a screen that displays **All tasks completed** screen. Users see this screen when they complete all the tasks on a given day.

## Note:

The solution code uses the basic composables covered in Unit 1, Pathway 3 for Android Basics in Compose:
- [Build a simple app with text composables](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-text-composables?#0)
- [Add images to your Android app](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-add-images?#0)
